# Autotune Image Slider

Introduce the project briefly; say what it is and what it does and why you might want to use or contribute to it.

This an image slider constructed as a blueprint for use within [Autotune](https://github.com/voxmedia/autotune).

## Getting started

After cloning the project:
1. Install dependencies by running: `$ bundle install`
2. Start middleman by running: `$ bundle exec middleman`

## Documentation

This project is structured as a blueprint created for use within Autotune. All blueprints are [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) projects constructed with a few additional components.

These components are:
- `data/autotune.json`
    - This is the data file that will be generated every time that a project is created in Autotune using this blueprint.
- `autotune-config.json`
    - This json file generates the user entry form for creating an image slider and must be included for the blueprint to function successfully within Autotune.
